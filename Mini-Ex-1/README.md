For my first mini exercise I had two objectives: firstly I wanted to explore parts of the p5.js library I hadn't tried before and secondly I wanted it to somehow relate to the texts we had read. I found the loadModel function and decided to explore that. This was the first objective completed. Following this I had to find a 3D model to use and here I decided on a model of the robot from the movie Big Hero Six. I chose this for several reasons - firstly the movie is set in a future where programming/robotics is absolutely essential to how the world works. Even the main character, who is just a young kid, is literate in computer programming. 

Initially I had planned to set the background as an old skateboarding image. I wanted to do this to contrast the different time periods; one where kids played in an analog way and another where the digital world had become an integrated part of their world. I had also planned to write some text aswell, but these plans went in the sink because 3D modelling and 2D text doesn't go well. The color variation and rotation were simply experimentation on how one could make the program evolve/change. 

Making this first mini exercise was exciting but also filled with challenges. I enjoyed having to google and youtube solutions and the feeling when the model finally loaded was great. I look forward to engaging in the next exercise!
