For this exercise I experienced a lot of frustration. Basically what my program does is first make you practice a tongue twister and then record you saying the tongue twister. After this the recording is played on your speakers but you are also sent at file. This soundfile is a recording of when you practiced the tongue twister where you weren't aware it was being recorded. 

Getting this to work took me quite some time, but afterwards I wanted to add some bubbles to the background to make the visual experience more fun and this turned out be quite a problem. In the code you can see that I tried to make these bubbles in several different ways but I couldn't get it to work. 

Anyway, even though I couldn't get the aesthetic I wanted, this program still communicates the idea of public recording that I wanted to convey.
