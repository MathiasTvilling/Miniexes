Approaching this mini-exercise was a bit of a challenge. We had to come up with something that could be thought of as fun, both in production and in experience. To me, something really fun is a puzzle. As Winnie said during the tuesday lecture, it's fun when something seems a bit off. Something is wrong. That's why I chose a background image that noone will find fun or lighthearted, so that you know something is off. You know the program is supposed to be about fun, but why is the hammer and sickle then there? As you're looking at the program a sound clip from a soviet arcade is running aswell, which makes it even more obvious something is off. Moving around your mouse moves some kind of rectangles that in some way resemble letters from the russian alphabet in their crudeness, but why are they there? 

If you move your mouse to somewhere between the coordinates (40, 40) and (60,60) the rectangles will turn white and spell out the word fun and here you might think that you've "won" the game, but there's another interaction. If you put the mouse into the opposite corner the text will turn black. I put this in as a kind of easter egg, because I once again think that the most fun things are the ones you discover without really knowing what you are looking for. 

I had a lot of fun making this and because of that I think others would have fun experiencing it.
