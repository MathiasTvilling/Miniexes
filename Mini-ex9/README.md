INDIVIDUAL

For this weeks mini exercise I chose to create a flowchart for my last mini exercise involving API's. Here's the link to that mini exercise:

Creating a flowchart for this was exciting because it seemed there were several different ways of doing it. Did I want a flowchart representing how the code works or how one interacts with the program? Therefore I made two versions, one technical one and a more conceptual one.

Here's the one with more focus on the technical aspect:

And here's the one with a more conceptual focus:

GROUP WORK

In my group we developed two different ideas.

Idea 1 is a twitter bot that searches for tweets tagget with #metoo. Once it finds these it reposts them from a male profile and reverses all gendered pronouns. The goal here is to explore how this would affect the debate regarding #metoo. Here is the flowchart for that idea:

Idea 2 is put shortly a different layout for facebook. We found the idea of hidden metrics really interesting and wanted to create a fake "layout" where different usually hidden metrics are shown. One would be able to interact with premade posts and post a "post" aswell, which would then be reacted to in a kind of animation. Here is that flowchart:

This wouldn't be a big issue technically but exploring hidden metrics would be an interesting process.

I found working with these flowcharts to be really interesting because it seemed to highlight some relation between code, language and algorithm. The program was in some way chopped into different short pieces of language then assembled into a coherent "algorithm". Just like with language the flowchart has a sort of grammar or syntax in the shapes and their functions, so even though the flowchart looks very technical it becomes very easily understood once one knows the syntax.
