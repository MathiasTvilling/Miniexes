Approaching this task I had the idea of time and uncertainty in mind. At first I wanted to create a uranium atom, since it's an unstable/uncertain atom, but it was too complex of a task so I decided on a carbon atom instead. I chose the carbon atom since it is a essential component to the universe, and I wanted my throbber to be the throbber of the universe. My program uses framerate to control both the rotation of the atom and the expansion/contraction of the electrons. These two act differently because of the use of the function sin() which also makes it function as a loop. I made it in this circular and pulsing way so that it would have the kind of hypnotizing effect throbbers have. 

I chose to make a couple of "stars" fly by because I thought some surprises might make the waiting less boring. This could be explored more. Jason Farmes says that the waiting is part of the message so is there any way we could make this "waiting message" better? Or more educational? Or profitable? These could all be interesting ways to take the throbber - maybe the youtube throbber could be replaced with a coca cola logo for a neat sum of money?
