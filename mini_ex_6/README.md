I wanted to create a simple program with simple rules but with enough randomness that it could create new art. I found the idea of generativity really interesting and the idea of authorship in such a situation. One could take snapshots of the creation and it is then their creation? Their curation? I found this really interesting. To implement a bit of authorship/creation I added the function clear() when you press the mousebutton. This makes it so that the watcher has some kind of control over where the circles appear. This is another place where the question of authorship comes into play. 


To create my program i made these rules:

1. There has to be a tight row of strings.
2. From the top left corner and the right bottom corner I want rings in increasing size to appear.
3. When they reach the opposite side they start over but from a random amount lower/higher on the y-axis.
4. When they reach the top/bottom the reset to the opposite.
5. When they reach a certain size they reset to a set minimum size.
6. The color of both strings and rings are the same but randomly generated.
7. When the mouse is pressed all drawn circles disappear.

This ended up working fine and this week I didn't experience a lot of frustration in relation to code, but maybe that means I didn't challenge myself enough. I spent a lot more time than usual just playing with the aesthetic of the program.
