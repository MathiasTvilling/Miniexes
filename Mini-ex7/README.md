Our program is called: "R U A DJ"
Made by: Cathrine, Mikael and Nicoline.

Approaching this mini exercise we tried to get as much inspiration online as we could. We looked through libraries of e-litterature, and found a lot of exciting stuff. 
A recurring element in these programs was the idea of the relationsship between code, language and sound. We found this element really interesting and we wanted to include it
in our program. We also talked about how the "natural" languages we use are socially constructed and discussed how they could be broken down. In our program we tried to 
do this "breaking down" of the language. The program is really simple, when you hit a key it displays the letter on the screen and a soundfile of it being read out loud is 
played. We chose to only use the letters of the english alphabet and we also chose to ignore all the signs on the keyboards. Trying to express yourself
through this program makes it obvious that language is more complex than just letters, syntax and rules of pronounciation is missing. In the text Vocable Code I found this 
quote:

"To attempt to understand a "text" like a sound poem  requires recognition that all languages consist of closed systems of discrete semiotic elements, and that meaning is
organized out of differences between elements that are meaningless in themselves."

This recognition that all languages consist of closed systems of discrete semiotic elements was the point we wanted to get across to the user. 
The "language" our program creates is completely without grammar and syntax, and this creates a kind of frustrating feeling. In the text Noam Chomskys
idea that humans possess an innate kind of grammar and maybe that is why this lack of grammar/order frustrates the user.
